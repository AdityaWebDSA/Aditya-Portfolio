<section id="belowcolumn">
    <h1 class="myh1">Why I Chose Web Development and C++ DSA? </h1>
        <p>For me, I love things related to editing, creativity, and designing. Web development allows me to build 
            beautiful, interactive, and user-friendly websites. 
            I enjoy creating stunning UI/UX, animations, and well
            structured pages that enhance the user experience. 
            Seeing a well-designed site come to life in the browser gives me a sense of satisfaction and creativity. 
            The future is of AI and beautiful designs, and I love using AI. So by using AI, I will definitely bring new 
            creative ideas in tech. It is almost a fully computer-related task, and I have loved computers since childhood. 
            The bond between me and computers is unique. I never feel bored while doing any task on a computer, like 
            editing or coding. 
            It always gives new challenges to my mind, and I learn new things daily. </p>
    
        <h1 class="myh1">Why also DSA IN C++  with web dev.? </h1>
        <p>C++ is known for its speed, efficiency, and low-level memory control, making it the best choice for Data 
            Structures and Algorithms (DSA). DSA helps in improving problem-solving skills, and it is important for 
            coding interviews and competitive programming. 
            By mastering DSA, I will increase my problem-solving skills to a legend level. Mark Zuckerberg once said 
            that coding improves thinking power, and it takes our thinking to another level. 
            Mastering DSA in C++ also opens doors to big tech companies. In my college, only local-level companies 
            come and put DSA as a major criterion. So for this purpose also, and to strengthen my logical thinking and 
            optimization skills, I am learning C++ DSA. </p>
    
    
   
        <h1 class="myh1">Why Not Other Fields? </h1>
        <p> 
            <ul>
            <li><b>AI/ML, CS =</b> I am more interested in designing and development rather than working on datasets and 
            models. In my college, AI/ML students are stuck, and the surrounding is important. </li>
            <li><b>GATE= </b>my core branch is ENTC , but from long years GATE was not my Aim </li>  
           <li> <b>App Development = </b>Web development feels more dynamic and visually engaging compared to mobile 
            apps. And I don’t like making apps. In fact, I also don’t like using mobile much, I mostly use my laptop. </li>
            <li><b>Game Development =</b> I have interest in gaming, and in childhood, I liked making games. But in foreign 
            countries like the USA, gaming is more developed than in India. Also, it requires deep graphics knowledge, 
            and I prefer working on real-world interactive websites.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
   

    
        <h1 class="myh1">Future Aim </h1>
        <p>My future aim is to become a Full-Stack Developer, like the GOAT (Greatest of All Time) in this field. I 
            want to master C++ DSA to crack top product-based companies and prove my skills and hard work 
            capability like Ronaldo shows in football.  
            I will also keep improving in UI/UX design to create visually appealing websites, in future, not thought so 
            much about that now,and in the future, I definitely want to learn and master UI/UX. 
            To achieve all this, I will build a strong portfolio that showcases my technical and creative abilities.  
            and also I will make website for our youtube news channel also, it will help a lot to improve and make 
            community strong and big. </p>

 <div id="ronoinline">
 <h1 id="headingsport"><u>My Favorite Sport and Inspiration</u>
<p id="sportinfo">
    Football has always been more than just a game for me... it's a passion that fuels my determination and discipline. Inspired by legends like <u>Cristiano Ronaldo</u>, I admire the dedication, resilience, and work ethic that the sport instills. Just like in coding and problem-solving, football teaches the importance of strategy, teamwork, and continuous improvement. Whether on the field or in front of a screen, I believe in pushing my limits and striving for excellence every day. Beyond being a sport, football is a way of life that teaches patience, consistency, and adaptability—qualities that are crucial in both professional and personal growth. The thrill of competition, the rush of scoring a goal, and the discipline of training mirror the journey of mastering new skills in programming and web development. Every match, like every project, is an opportunity to learn, improve, and evolve. This mindset of continuous learning and never giving up is what drives me in all aspects of life.
